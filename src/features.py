'''
feature extractions that we perform on the data:

1. Quadrant intensity: We divide the image into four quadrants and sum intensity of each quadrant. This gives us a feature vector of size 4.
2. Horizontal and vertical symmetry: We check if the image is symmetric along the horizontal and vertical axes. This gives us a feature vector of size 2.
3: Projection features: We compute the sum of pixel intensities in the top and bottom halves of the image, and also compute the standard deviation of pixel intensities across rows and columns. This gives us a feature vector of size 4.
4. Edge transitions: We count the number of horizontal and vertical transitions in the image. This gives us a feature vector of size 2.
